I write about software architecture, systems, and the quiet failures that appear long before anything breaks.

This site is not a blog. It is a public thinking surface — a place to reason about change, judgment, and complexity without hiding behind recipes or best practices.

Most technical writing focuses on solutions. I am more interested in how people arrive at them, especially when the rules stop working and decisions become irreversible.

The essays here are not how-to guides. They are attempts to surface the hidden structure behind familiar problems, so that readers can recognize patterns in their own systems.

There are no frameworks to adopt here. Only models to test.
