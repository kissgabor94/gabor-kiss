This site contains essays about software systems, architecture, and decision-making under real constraints.

It focuses on what happens when rules, frameworks, and process stop being sufficient — and judgment becomes unavoidable.

As a starting point, I recommend the following essays:

- [Simplicity Takes Work](/essays/simplicity-takes-work/)
- [Coupling Is Not Evil — It’s a Commitment](/essays/coupling-is-commitment/)
- [Testing Makes You Faster](/essays/testing-makes-you-faster-eventually/)
