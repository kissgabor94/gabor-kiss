This site contains essays about software systems, architecture, and decision-making under real constraints.

It focuses on what happens when rules, frameworks, and process stop being sufficient — and judgment becomes unavoidable.

As a starting point, I recommend the following essays:

- [Shaping The Problem](/essays/shaping-the-problem/)
- [Architecture Scales Down: The Same Rules Everywhere](/essays/architecture-scales-down/)
- [Coupling Is Not Evil — It’s a Commitment](/essays/coupling-is-commitment/)
