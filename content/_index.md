This website is a slowly growing collection of essays about software architecture, systems, change, and how decisions actually get made when the rules stop working.

The goal is not to provide answers, but to make better questions unavoidable.

As a starting point, I recommend the following essays:

- [Simplicity Takes Work](/essays/simplicity-takes-work/)
- [Coupling Is Not Evil — It’s a Commitment](/essays/coupling-is-not-evil/)
- [3 Levels of Thinking](/essays/three-levels-of-thinking/)
